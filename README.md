As of the time of this writing, the code has been verified to work with Mozilla firefox. The code fetches the Json data from Github, so you will need to be connected to the internet when opening the web page. I've also included two files, "codeChallengeCSS" and "codeChallengeJS", which contain the CSS and javascript files, respectively. Feel free to review them using any plain text reader. 
They were written using the 'SublimeText' program. 

Extra Features:

* Two views: The program allows the user to switch between two views: "default view" and "extended view." "Default view" contains
  the data per the challenge requirements, whereas "Extended view" contains all data laid out in a table. You can switch between 
  the views by using their respective buttons located bellow the table. 
  
* Expandability: The code design was intended to allow for easy expandability. Anyone accessing the code should be able to create
  new views and easily expand upon the presentation. 

* Reusability: The code design should only require minor modifications to make it usable with other sets of data. This feature 
  reduces uncessary time spent in the future.
